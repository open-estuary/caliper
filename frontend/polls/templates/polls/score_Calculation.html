<h1> The method of Caliper score calculation </h1>
<p>
We begin the computation by obtaining the original values from the output log which is generated by executing each test tool on target. These original values are then categorized in to <strong>Two top Dimensions</strong>,Performance and Functional. This is further sub-divide based on which <strong>sub-system</strong>(CPU, Memory, Algorithm etc) they belong to.

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p> After the classification is done we normalize these original values into a smaller dynamic range. Care is taken to convert all values which are interpreted as <strong>"Smaller the better"</strong> to <strong>"Higher the better"</strong> to get a uniform method of interpreting the results as <strong>Higher the score, better the performance!</strong>.

<p> Total scores for each sub-system are then computed by taking the <strong>geometrical mean</strong> of all the individual test scenarios which comes under it. This is further calculated by taking the <strong>geometrical mean</strong> of each set of participating test cases that come under each scenarios </p>

<p> These calculated scores are then compared across platforms and then converted them to percentiles. Which means the highest value in each category will have the value of 100 and rest will be relative percentile score to this. Percentile calculation is applied to each sub system and also for each test cases under specific category and these values are referred in the report.
