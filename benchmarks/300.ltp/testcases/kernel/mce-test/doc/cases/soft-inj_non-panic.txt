Overall:(4 cases)

- Test method
  * Preparation
    + Disable mcelog cron job
  * Add cases/soft-inj/non-panic/cases.sh into configuration file, and invoke
    a test driver on it.
- Common
  * Test script of test cases in this file can be found in
    cases/soft-inj/non-panic/cases.sh


1. corrected

- Objective:
  * Test machine_check_poll() and mce_log()
- Code path tested:
  * machine_check_poll()
  * mce_get_rip(), branch without EIPV, RIPV, rip_msr
  * mce_log()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/non-panic/data/corrected
- Expected results:
  * MCE records gotten via /dev/mcelog is same as injected ones
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing


2. corrected hold

- Objective:
  * Whether is there race condition in machine_check_poll() and mce_log(),
    multiple machine_check_poll() or mce_log() may be run simultaneously
    on difference CPU.
- Code path tested:
  * same as corrected
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/non-panic/data/corrected_hold
- Expected results:
  * MCE records gotten via /dev/mcelog is same as injected ones
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing


3. corrected over

- Objective:
  * Test OVER processing
- Code path tested:
  * same as 1
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/non-panic/data/corrected_over
- Expected results:
  * MCE records gotten via /dev/mcelog is same as injected ones
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing


4. corrected without EN

- Objective:
  * Test no EN processing
- Code path tested:
  * same as 1
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/non-panic/data/corrected_no_en
- Expected results:
  * MCE records gotten via /dev/mcelog is same as injected ones
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing
