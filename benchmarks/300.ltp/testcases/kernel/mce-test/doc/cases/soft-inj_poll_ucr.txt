Overall:(2 cases)

- Test method
  * Preparation
    + Disable mcelog cron job
  * Add cases/soft-inj/panic_ucr/cases.sh into configuration file, and invoke
    a test driver on it.
- Common
  * Test script of test cases in this file can be found in
    cases/soft-inj/panic_ucr/cases.sh


1. ucna

- Objective:
  * Test severity comparison logic of MCE handler
  * Test logic of uncorrected with POLL
- Code path tested:
  * machine_check_poll() except
        if (!(flags & MCP_UC) &&
            (m.status & (mce_ser ? MCI_STATUS_S : MCI_STATUS_UC))
  * mce_log()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/poll_ucr/data/ucna
- Expected result:
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.


2. ucna_over

- Objective:
  * Test severity comparison logic of MCE handler
  * Test logic of uncorrected with POLL
- Code path tested:
  * machine_check_poll() except
        if (!(flags & MCP_UC) &&
            (m.status & (mce_ser ? MCI_STATUS_S : MCI_STATUS_UC))
  * mce_log()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/poll_ucr/data/ucna_over
- Expected result:
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
