Overall: (3 cases)

- Test method
  * Add cases/soft-inj/panic_noser/cases.sh into configuration file, and invoke
    a test driver on it.
- Common
  * Test script of test cases in this file can be found in
    cases/soft-inj/panic_noser/cases.sh

1. uc_over

- Objective:
  * Test MSR read logic of MCE handler
  * Test synchronization between monarch and subject
  * Test logic of uncorrected with UC and OVER
- Code path tested:
  * do_machine_check()
  * mce_start()
  * mce_timeout() except if (*t <= 0) branch
  * mce_log()
  * mce_end()
  * mce_severity()
  * mce_reign() until mce_panic("Fatal Machine check",)
  * mce_panic()
  * print_mce()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic_noser/data/uc_over
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Fatal Machine check"
  * Exception message is "Overflowed uncorrected"


2. uc_over_corrected

- Objective:
  * Test synchronization between monarch and subject
  * Test logic of uncorrected and corrected
  * Test logic of uncorrected with UC and OVER
  * Test logic of corrected with EXCP
- Code path tested:
  * do_machine_check()
  * mce_start()
  * mce_timeout() except if (*t <= 0) branch
  * mce_log()
  * mce_end()
  * mce_severity()
  * mce_reign() until mce_panic("Fatal Machine check",)
  * mce_panic()
  * print_mce()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic_noser/data/uc_over_corrected
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Fatal Machine check"
  * Exception message is "Overflowed uncorrected"


3. uc_over_timeout

- Objective:
  * Test logic of timeout during monarch/subject synchronization
  * Test logic of uncorrected with UC and OVER
- Code path tested:
  * do_machine_check()
  * mce_start()
  * mce_timeout() if (*t <= 0) branch
  * mce_log()
  * mce_severity()
  * mce_panic("Fatal machine check on current CPU",)
  * print_mce()
- Reference:
  * Inject data file: cases/soft-inj/panic_noser/data/uc_over_timeout
- Expected result:
  * No warning or bug during kernel processing.
  * MCE records collected via kernel panic log is same as reference ones.
  * Kernel panic message is "Fatal machine check on current CPU"
  * Exception message is "Overflowed uncorrected"
  * Timeout message is "Some CPUs didn't answer in synchronization"
