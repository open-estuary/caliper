/*
 * Out Of Memory (OOM) for Memory Resource Controller
 *
 * The program is designed to cope with unpredictable like amount and
 * system physical memory, swap size and other VMM technology like KSM,
 * memcg, memory hotplug and so on which may affect the OOM
 * behaviours. It simply increase the memory consumption 3G each time
 * until all the available memory is consumed and OOM is triggered.
